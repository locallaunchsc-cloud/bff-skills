# sBTC Yield Maximizer

## What it does

Compares live Zest sBTC yield against current Bitflow sBTC HODLMM opportunity and routes idle sBTC to the highest safe path. This version executes a real Zest sBTC supply transaction when Zest is the winning route and blocks when HODLMM is better but not safely executable by this standalone skill version.

## Why agents need it

Agents should not deploy sBTC based on static assumptions. They need a real decision layer that checks current yield, stale pricing risk, HODLMM liquidity quality, and wallet reserves before capital moves. This skill turns that decision into a repeatable, guardrailed write flow.

## Safety notes

- Writes to chain. `run` signs and broadcasts a real Zest sBTC supply transaction when Zest is the winning route.
- Mainnet only. Routing data and write execution target live mainnet protocols.
- Wallet password required. The skill unlocks the local AIBTC wallet at execution time using `AIBTC_WALLET_PASSWORD`.
- Reserve enforced. The wallet retains at least `--reserve-sats` after the write path.
- Deploy cap enforced. The routed amount is capped by `--max-deploy-sats`.
- Gas reserve enforced. The wallet must keep at least `--min-gas-reserve-ustx`.
- Post-conditions enforced. The Zest service-layer write path uses `PostConditionMode.Deny`.
- HODLMM stale-price gate enforced. Pools with price divergence above `--max-price-divergence-pct` are disqualified from winning.
- HODLMM liquidity gates enforced. Pools below the configured TVL or 24h volume floors are disqualified.
- Cooldown enforced. Repeated route execution is blocked until `--cooldown-hours` has elapsed.
- Explicit confirmation required. `run` refuses to execute unless `--confirm=MAXIMIZE` is provided.
- Wallet is re-locked after the attempted write path.

## Commands

### doctor
Checks wallet resolution, STX and sBTC balances, Zest vault reads, Bitflow pool reads, and whether the current configuration can execute the winning route safely.

```bash
bun run skills/sbtc-yield-maximizer/sbtc-yield-maximizer.ts doctor
```

### install-packs
Lists the required runtime packages used by this skill.

```bash
bun run skills/sbtc-yield-maximizer/sbtc-yield-maximizer.ts install-packs
```

### status
Shows live balances, route candidates, route scores, Zest rate reads, the top HODLMM candidate, and the current winning route.

```bash
bun run skills/sbtc-yield-maximizer/sbtc-yield-maximizer.ts status
```

### run
Unlocks the wallet, re-checks the route decision, and executes a real Zest sBTC supply when Zest is the winning safe route.

```bash
AIBTC_WALLET_PASSWORD='your-password' bun run skills/sbtc-yield-maximizer/sbtc-yield-maximizer.ts run --confirm=MAXIMIZE
```

Example tuned run:

```bash
AIBTC_WALLET_PASSWORD='your-password' bun run skills/sbtc-yield-maximizer/sbtc-yield-maximizer.ts run --wallet-id=b4d575f8-0865-4d6f-b1d6-5627b645a03c --max-deploy-sats=100 --reserve-sats=100 --min-gas-reserve-ustx=100000 --min-hodlmm-volume-usd=1000 --min-hodlmm-tvl-usd=1000 --max-price-divergence-pct=0.5 --confirm=MAXIMIZE
```

## Known constraints

- This version executes the Zest route when Zest is the winning route. When HODLMM wins, the skill reports that outcome but does not attempt a direct HODLMM LP deposit.
- Zest sBTC yield is derived from live on-chain Zest vault reads and interpreted as a basis-points-style supply signal. This was verified against the live `v0-vault-sbtc` source, which defines `BPS u10000` and applies rate math in basis points.
- HODLMM opportunity is derived from live Bitflow app and quote APIs using APR, fee run-rate, volume, TVL, and stale-price checks.
- Requires enough sBTC to exceed reserve and enough STX to preserve gas reserve.
